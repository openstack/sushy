    Enhances the existing LLDPReceiveField class by adding new LLDP receive data
    fields as specified in Redfish Port Schema v1.12.0. The existing class already
    contained chassis_id and port_id fields, and this enhancement adds 9 additional
    LLDP receive properties.

    New LLDP receive fields added:
    - chassis_id_subtype: IEEE 802 chassis ID subtype identification
    - port_id_subtype: IEEE 802 port ID subtype with MAC address handling
    - system_name: System name received from remote link partner
    - system_description: System description from remote link partner
    - system_capabilities: Network device capabilities mapping
    - management_address_ipv4: IPv4 management address
    - management_address_ipv6: IPv6 management address
    - management_address_mac: MAC management address
    - management_vlan_id: Management VLAN ID configuration (0-4095)

    This enhancement provides LLDP receive information through
    the EthernetField.lldp_receive property, enabling better network topology
    discovery.
