    Improve Redfish VirtualMedia ``InsertMedia`` error handling on BMCs that
    require credentials but return unstructured errors (e.g., responses that
    omit ``error.code`` and report ``ActionParameterMissing`` only via
    ``@Message.ExtendedInfo`` or free-text messages). Sushy now detects these
    cases and retries with ``UserName``/``Password`` parameters, allowing ISO
    mounting to proceed. This also preserves compatibility with legacy
    ``error.code == *GeneralError`` responses that mention missing parameters.
