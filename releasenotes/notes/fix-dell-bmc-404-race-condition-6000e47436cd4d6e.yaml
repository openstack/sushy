    An issue was encountered on Dell hardware where the Baseboard Management
    Controller could respond with a HTTP 404 error temporarily during job
    creation, causing operations to fail unnecessarily. This occurred due to
    a race condition where the BMC had not yet finished creating the job
    when the initial request was made. The Dell OEM http_call method now
    automatically retries on 404 responses with configurable retry count
    (default: 3 retries) and delay (default: 10 seconds) to handle this
    transient condition gracefully. The retry behavior can be customized
    using the ``max_404_retries`` and ``retry_404_delay`` parameters.
