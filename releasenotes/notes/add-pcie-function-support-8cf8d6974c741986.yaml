    Adds PCIe function support to Sushy with complete Redfish
    PCIeFunction v1.6.0 specification compliance. This extends the existing
    PCIe device support with detailed function-level information.

    Features include:

    * PCIeFunction resource with complete field specification including
      function ID, type, protocol, device class, vendor/device IDs, and
      PCI addressing fields
    * PCIeFunctionCollection with caching and error handling capabilities
    * Integration with existing PCIeDevice.pcie_functions property
    * Handling of missing PCIeFunctions attribute for BMCs that
      don't support function-level details
    * Test coverage validated with real Dell PowerEdge hardware
      via Ironic integration

    This enhancement provides users with detailed insights into individual
    PCIe functions within multi-function devices, enabling better hardware
    inventory management and troubleshooting capabilities.
